# STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS

# statistical analysis in python with wine dataset

Certainly! The wine dataset is a collection of data related to different types of wines, often used for machine learning and data analysis. There are several wine datasets available, but one of the most well-known is the Wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repostory

# This is brief overview of dataset:
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Features: The dataset includes a set of attributes or features related to chemical properties of wine. These features often include measurements like alcohol content, malic acid, ash, alcalinity of ash, magnesium, total phenols, flavanoids, nonflavanoid phenols, proanthocyanins, color intensity, hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines, and proline.

Target Variable: The target variable is typically the class of the wine, which is often a classification into different types of wine (e.g., varieties of wine).

Number of Instances: The dataset usually contains 178 instances (wines).

Number of Features: There are 13 features used to describe each wine.

Classes: There are 3 different classes of wine in the dataset.

Class 0: This typically represents one type of wine (e.g., a specific varietal like "class 0").

Class 1: This represents another type of wine (e.g., a different varietal or category).

Class 2: This represents the third type of wine.

# NOTE :
The exact names of the classes are not specified in the dataset itself, but they correspond to different types of wines based on their chemical properties. The dataset is used to classify wines into these three categories based on the features provided.

* The dataset is commonly used for classification tasks in machine learning, such as predicting the type of wine based on its chemical properties.
